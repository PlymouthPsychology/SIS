Quoting someone else does not show that you understand the point; putting into your own words does."},{"symbol":"Better link needed","description":"Here you change topic abruptly - you need to link your material. Each paragraph should lead into the point that the next is making."},{"symbol":"cite references","description":"Support this by citing a specific work e.g., Author (Year) or make a point and back it up with a citation (Authors, Year)"},{"symbol":"clear understanding","description":"this is a good section that shows you have a clear understanding of the material"},{"symbol":"confusing","description":"write as simply and concisely as you can - the meaning should be clear."},{"symbol":"correct but not vital?","description":"This is correct but does not seem necessary to answer the question. When planning your essay make sure every point is needed."},{"symbol":"correct but unclear","description":"This is essentially correct but you have not explained it very clearly."},{"symbol":"don't abbreviate","description":"Abbreviating this key term does not save you much space, but makes your essay hard to read. It is probably better to spell it out in full and economise elsewhere."},{"symbol":"explain first","description":"You should explain this idea first before presenting evidence which supports or challenges it."},{"symbol":"Good APA style","description":"References well-formatted using APA style - thank you!"},{"symbol":"Good conclusion","description":"This is a good conclusion, summing up without repeating yourself, and answering the question in a nutshell based on the points you have made in the body of the essay."},{"symbol":"good definitions","description":"It is good to have a concise introduction like this that defines the topics central to the essay but try to explain why the question itself is worth answering."},{"symbol":"good example","description":"this is a good example which makes the point concrete for the reader and shows that you understand it&nbsp;"},{"symbol":"good independent research","description":"good - evidence here that you have read around and found novel material beyond the reading list"},{"symbol":"good material","description":"Good - well done for using material not covered in the lectures"},{"symbol":"Good section","description":"This is a good section, accurate and concise."},{"symbol":"Help with your writing","description":"I recommend that you take advantage of the help provided by the Writing Café, which runs online and in the Library.

Your argument should link the paragraphs so needing linking words indicates a weak argument. The last sentence of a paragraph should provide a link to the next paragraph."},{"symbol":"mind or brain?","description":"Take care not to confuse things the MIND does with things the BRAIN does - the brain is a physical thing; the mind is the processes and contents supported by the brain."},{"symbol":"missing theoretical background","description":"It would help to explain the theoretical background first to put this section into context"},{"symbol":"more detail needed","description":"You need to explain this in a bit more detail to show to me that you really understand it"},{"symbol":"not answering the question","description":"This paragraph is not directly relevant to the question, so is not helping your argument. Try to identify digressions from the argument at the planning stage before writing the essay."},{"symbol":"Paragraph too long","description":"This paragraph contains several points - each para should make a Point, give Evidence, Evaluate the point, and Link to the next para (PEEL). Using shorter paragraphs makes your argument easier to write, and easier to read."},{"symbol":"poor essay structure","description":"Your essay is not well structured – paragraphs hop from topic to topic and the sentences within each paragraph do not always follow on from each other. When you are planning your essay, make sure that it is not just a list of points, but that there is a logical order to them."},{"symbol":"reference primary sources","description":"Take care to reference credible academic sources in your work rather than websites. By credible, I mean papers in journals which have been peer reviewed, or academic books. When you find a useful website or non-peer reviewed article, look to see where its evidence comes from, and then refer to that if it is credible."},{"symbol":"repetition","description":"You have already made this point earlier in the essay"},{"symbol":"Run-on","description":"Run-on sentence:<br>The sentence contains two or more independent clauses.

Try reading your draft aloud to spot &nbsp;sentences that are poorly structured."},{"symbol":"Strong introduction","description":"This is a strong introduction that makes the reader understand why the question is worth answering."},{"symbol":"too general","description":"This section is too general - you can assume that readers have a basic background knowledge and should stick to the key material needed to answer the question"},{"symbol":"too much methods","description":"too much methodology detail in this para - focus on what a paper finds and use it as evidence to support a point you are making, or your essay becomes too descriptive"},{"symbol":"Use APA format","description":"Please check how to give references in APA format - see the guide at<a href=\"https://plymouth.libguides.com/c.php?g=690218&p=4943165\">https://plymouth.libguides.com/c.php?g=690218&p=4943165</a>"},{"symbol":"Use hanging indentation","description":"Good use of APA format but please use a hanging margin, so that the author names are easily visible and the following lines are indented."},{"symbol":"well argued","description":"you have made this point well and provided good evidence, showing that you understand it"}],"QuickMarkTemplateSet":[{"name":"School of Psychology generic"}]}
