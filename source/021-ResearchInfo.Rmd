# Research Information 

This section provides a quick overview of the systems in place to support the research activities of Academic Staff in the School of Psychology. It contains references to the links on the main post, but no actual links. It is structured to match the main page.

## School Seminars

There is normally a research seminar every Wednesday afternoon in teaching weeks, to which all staff and students are invited, with tea/coffee/biscuits beforehand. The Seminar Organisor* will periodically ask for suggestions about people to invite, and this is a good way to get a colleague elsewhere to visit so you can discuss research ideas or other collborations. The School will pay for their travel and overnight accommodation, and also an evening meal (for two staff and the speaker).

* To find out who is currently in a management role such as Seminar Organiser or AHoS-Research, consult the Management Roles link.

## Funding

The majority of Academic Contracts in the School include Research and the School is keen that everyone should be in a position to obtain external research funding. The Associate Head of School for Research (AHoS-Research)* is responsible for helping you to achieve this, and it will be discussed at your annual Performance and Development Review (PDR) meeting.

The UK Research Councils use a common submission portal, **Je-S,** but **Funder Information** provides links to their main sites. Note that Je-S is soon to be replaced by a new system.

The University has a team to provide **Support for Proposal Writing**, with a **Grant application flowchart** to help you through the process, and there are several links here on strategies to improve the chanes for your proposal, as well as a summary of the **Support available in School.** The Research office host a page whjioch includes access to a **successful applications library**, which is very useful for working out how to best write your proposal.

Not all research requires a large amount of external funding, and often pilot work needs to be done to make applications more likely to succeed. You can ask the School for small amounts of funding to conduct studies, provided that you can give a brief 'business case'. Depending upon the state of finances, there may be emails about 'Pump Priming' schemes or similar from the AHoS-R, with deadlines, or you may be able to apply at any time. It is best to just ask. With the opening of BRIC, some funding is available for **proof-of-concept** studies using the MRI scanner.

The **Award Manager** system within Unit4 should be used throughout the proposal writing, costing, reviewing, approval and submission process, and then once you get your grant to manage the project. You need to contact Funding Advisory to get access to this system, and it then appears in the left hand menu when you access Business World through Corporate Self-Service.

Once you have won funding, you will be supported by the Finance Office. Your project will be given a *'* *Work Order* **'** code that you will need to quote to get anything bought for you. The code will be two letters and six digits, e.g., RR105183, and may be followed by budget line codes of a dash and three digits e.g., '-101'. Finance will provide you with summaries of the costs and budgets regularly, but also on request. There is no facility for you to manage the budgets yourself, or to inspect them online. Be aware that costs (especially staff costs) often take several weeks to make it through their systems, so the information you receive reflects some time in the past rather than a current snapshot. Do check the costs carefully as mistakes do happen. **You cannot buy anything** yourself and expect to be reimbused, except for food and accommodation. Ask the School Office or Tech Office to make small purchases online using the School Credit Card, but larger purchases may require authorisation, especially computing equipment. Travel and Accommodation should be booked through Key Travel (see Financial Stuff in Management). When you use KeyTravel, you provide the Word Order code to charge things directly to your project. After your trip, subsistence costs can be reimbursed by making an *Expense Claim* using Unit4, which you will definitely need help to do the first few times. Keep all receipts, scan them, and then upload the scans to Unit4 (beware of file size limits). See the nit4 section at the end of the Management column.

Projects that pay for staff time generate a surplus for the University, some of which is returned to the School Budget, and which can be made available for you to spend via a *Strategic Research Account (SRA)* **.** Any money allotted must be spent by the end of the financial year (July 30th). The balance will remain in your SRA, but the school will no longer have it, so it is illusory. Getting money put into your SRA is not automatic, and you cannot easily tell what is in your SRA other then by using Unit4. Ask the AHoS-Research for help when you get into this position.

## Doing Research

### Applying for ethics

Before collecting any research data, whether or not you expect it to be published, you need to obtain **ethical approval**. For Staff and Postgraduates, there is an **Online System** to complete which will send your application to the Faculty Ethical Committee. It can take several weeks for scrutiny and changes are often requested, so apply in good time. Note that for any research conducted away from the University, a letter from the host organisation giving permission is required.

### Getting help running research

You can get Undergraduates to help run your research in four ways: by signing them up each Easter as next year's Stage 4 or Stage 5 *Dissertation Students*; by taking them on as *Research Apprentices*; by recruiting them as an *Internal Placement Student*; or by employing them for a few weeks during the summer vacation on an *Internship*. Apprentices can be recruited for half a day a week for ten weeks (nominally, this is flexible) by placing an **advert** and then **registering** them. They are usually Stage 1 or 2 students who volunteer in exchange for an insight into research techniques before doing their project, but some Stage 4 or 5 students also volunteer to broaden their experience. You can ask for extra Participation Points as an incentive to take them on (but they do not get any other resoucres). **Summer Employment** can be done through the research assisstance scheme and they can earn £200 for up to ten weeks. Details should be given to you by email towards the end of Semester 2. Placement Students take a whole year out of their course to do work experience with you and are a more serious commitment. You will be treated like an external palcement host. You must advertise, interview, and appoint via the placement office, between January and Easter. The placement runs for 36 weeks between September and June. Places are limited so liaise with the School's Internal Placements Tutor.

The Library collection and online journals is accessible through **Primo** (and should be , so our access is recorded and journals seen as highly used). We have access to the **Scopus** and **Web of Science** databases. As people did not use Primo, we no longer have subscriber access to APA journals, so you will have to scour Google Scholar for illicitly uploaded PDFs.

#### Summer Internships for students

We can pay students a bursary (as ‘financial assistance’) rather than wages because:

1. The scheme is not internship or employment.

2. The scheme is an enhanced learning opportunity for students who have demonstrated a significant aptitude in subject areas.

3. The learning opportunity allows the student to practise in a live working environment whilst under supervision.

4. The student must produce written results either during or at the termination of the project.

5. The scheme takes place during the vacation period and the maximum attendance will be ten weeks.

6. The £200 weekly payment is as per guidance from the British Psychological Society and is to be paid as financial assistance to enable the student to remain in Plymouth to take part in the scheme.

The payments will be processed through P2P in Finance by completing Request for Payment forms (RFP) – see link below. Information required will be student name, number, bank details and reason for payment - to be presented as **Undergraduate Research Assistance Payment**. These payments will be made at the start and at the end of the scheme rather than weekly.

Important points for potential supervisors, to satisfy the above requirements:

* 1. Students should be paid in two lump sums
* 2. Supervisors and students should agree a set of learning outcomes before the placement begins, to be included in the report…
* 3. They should write a report on their work, to be read and commented on by the supervisor and sent to AHoS for Research at the end of the period of research.
* 4. The scheme is open to students at the end of stage 2, stage 3 if they have been on placement, and stage 4 if they are progressing to stage 5 on the MPsych programme. Students who have completed an undergraduate degree and are progressing straight onto a higher degree (MSc or full-time PhD), with only the academic summer holiday in between, also qualify.
* 5. All students should be made aware that this opportunity is potentially available. We will do this by advertising it as a possible outcome of successful research apprenticeships (JA action).

[Link to the RFP form to use](https://liveplymouthac.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/SchoolofPsychologyStaff/Shared%20Documents/General/sis/files/Payment%20Request%20Form.xlsx?d=w51c9a1805cbe4b5bb2dd1116001b907d&csf=1&web=1&e=5rrIS9)
Send to the School Office who will check it is correct before you send to payments.

Now if you want to pay someone for work, so with taxes etc. you will need to raise another type of contract, and then the person to contact about tax, etc is Rachel Edwards

### Designing experiments

The open platform **OpenSesame** has been adopted to support computer based experimentation, and the school has a **JATOS** server to run experiments online (ask Tech Office for an account). For online surveys, the school currently has a paid-for **Qualtrics** aaccount and there is an active user group for it, although future funding is not certain. You can obtain a login from **PsyResources**. Some staff might have *SurveyMonkey* accounts funded by research grants and if you ask around they may share access. The University prefers **JISC-Online Surveys** and you can obtain an account from the IT Support Portal (aka TIS).
