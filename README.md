# SIS-archive
This is an archive of the SIS pages from Discourse made in January 2025 (just in case)

The markdown from the main SIS posts was copied into .Rmd files and a Bookdown project created to compile them into an html book which can be viewed in _main.html

This folder was placed in the **School of Psychology Staff**  Teams site, in **General / sis**
subsequently renamed **Old SIS site**

uploaded files were downloaded to **/files** and links in the Markdown files updated

No maintenance is planned so this site will slowly drift out of date but as I relied on it to find my way around the University I did not want it to vanish. The SIS can be used by opening _main.html in a browser. Bookmarking it facilitates access.

If anyone does want to update the site, open the .Rproj file, edit the .Rmd and click the Build button in the Environment pane.
