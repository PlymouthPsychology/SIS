This is a bookdown version of the School Information Site.

To revise, open the Rproj file in RStudio, then edit the relevant Chapter file (.Rmd)
Once editing is complete use the Build tab to build the book.

Doing this requires you to have installed and loaded the bookdown package.

This site was originally built in Sharepoint, and then co-designed with new staff to supplement their induction into the School of Psychology.
It was moved to Discourse, and is preserved here to help future and current staff.
