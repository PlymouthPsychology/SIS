# Office Hours


## What are office hours?

All academic staff should schedule 2 hours each week for students to visit with questions or to get help with academic aspects of the course.

## Where do students book office hours?

The scheduler tool on the DLE is used for this. All staff have a scheduler created for them and it can be found here:

## Creating Office Hour Slots in the DLE using Moodle's Scheduler

By default, with no slots created, and clicking on your scheduler will show you this page:

The text in the booking instructions is standard text inserted into every scheduler. You modify this text by clicking on the gear icon in the top right corner and selecting edit settings.

You will also see that a very large number of students ‘still need to make an appointment’. Ignore this. Clicking on the cross to the right of this message will dismiss it, but it will reappear next time you access the scheduler.

To add slots, click on ‘Add Slots’ and then select ‘Add repeated slots’ to create multiple sessions. The follow options will appear.

Create the slots by clicking on ‘Save changes’. You will be taken back to the list of slots in your scheduler showing the newly create slots.

## Worked example

You want to create slots for the whole of the first term (12 weeks starting 26th October 2022). Slots should be created for 1 – 2pm on a Monday and 3 – 4pm on a Thursday.

Set 1 to 26 October 2022.

Click enable in 2 and set 2 to 16 December 2022.

In 3, select only Monday.

Set 4 to read: 13 00 and 14 00.

5 – 9 should be on their defaults. Check that they are.

Enter your meeting location in 10 and select your name from 11. Change 13 to ‘On the morning of the appointment’.

Click ‘Save changes’.

This will create the slots for Mondays between 26th October 2022 and Friday 16th December. Now repeat the process for the Thursday slots. Every setting will need to be the same other than 3 and 4 – change these as appropriate and click ‘Save changes’.
